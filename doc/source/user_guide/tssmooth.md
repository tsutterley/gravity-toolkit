tssmooth.py
===========

- Computes a moving average of a time-series using three possible routines:
    1. centered moving average
    2. 13-month Loess filter (default)
    3. weighted 13-month Loess filter

#### Calling Sequence
```python
from gravity_toolkit.tssmooth import tssmooth
smth = tssmooth(t_in, d_in, HFWTH=6)
```
[Source code](https://github.com/tsutterley/read-GRACE-harmonics/blob/main/gravity_toolkit/tssmooth.py)

#### Inputs
- `t_in`: input time array
- `d_in`: input data array

#### Options
- `MOVING`: calculates centered moving average using mean of window
- `WEIGHT`: use smoothing algorithm that backward models dates before half-width and forward models dates after half-width
    * `0` use unweighted Loess filter
    * `1` use linear weights with Loess filter
    * `2` use gaussian weights with Loess filter
- `HFWTH`: half-width of the moving average
- `DATA_ERR`: input error for known and equal errors
- `STDEV`: standard deviation of output error
- `CONF`: confidence interval of output error

#### Outputs
- `time`: time after removing start and end half-windows
- `data`: smoothed time-series
- `season`: seasonal component calculated by the Loess filter
- `annual`: annual component calculated by the Loess filter
- `semiann`: semi-annual component calculated by the Loess filter
- `trend`: instantaneous trend calculated by the Loess filter
- `error`: estimated error of the instantaneous trend
- `noise`: remaining noise after removing the trend and seasonal components
- `reduce`: original time series after removing start and end half-windows
