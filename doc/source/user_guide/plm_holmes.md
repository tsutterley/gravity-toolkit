=============

- Computes fully-normalized associated Legendre Polynomials and their first derivative for a vector of x values using the [Holmes and Featherstone (2002)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00190-002-0216-2) recursion relation
- Recursion relation is stable up to very high degree and order

#### Calling Sequence
```python
from gravity_toolkit.plm_holmes import plm_holmes
plm,dplm = plm_holmes(LMAX, x)
```
[Source code](https://github.com/tsutterley/read-GRACE-harmonics/blob/main/gravity_toolkit/plm_holmes.py)

#### Inputs
- `LMAX`: Upper bound of Spherical Harmonic Degrees
- `x`: elements ranging from -1 to 1. Typically cos(theta), where theta is the colatitude in radians

#### Options
- `ASTYPE`: output variable type. Default is 64-bit floating point

#### Outputs
- `plms`: Legendre polynomials of x (geodesy normalization)
- `dplms`: first differentials of Legendre polynomials of x
