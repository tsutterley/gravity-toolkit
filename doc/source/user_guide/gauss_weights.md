gauss_weights.py
================

- Computes the Gaussian weights as a function of degree
- A normalized version of [Christopher Jekeli's Gaussian averaging function](http://www.geology.osu.edu/~jekeli.1/OSUReports/reports/report_327.pdf)

#### Calling Sequence
```python
from gravity_toolkit.gauss_weights import gauss_weights
wl = 2.0*np.pi*gauss_weights(hw,LMAX)
```
[Source code](https://github.com/tsutterley/read-GRACE-harmonics/blob/main/gravity_toolkit/gauss_weights.py)

#### Inputs
1. `hw`: Gaussian smoothing radius in km
2. `LMAX`: Upper bound of Spherical Harmonic Degrees

#### Outputs
- `wl`: Gaussian weights for each degree `l`
