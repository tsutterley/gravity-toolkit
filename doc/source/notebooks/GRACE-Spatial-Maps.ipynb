    "\n",
    "This ({nb-download}`notebook <GRACE-Spatial-Maps.ipynb>`) demonstrates calculating spatial maps from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and the GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) Level-2 spherical harmonic products.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary and secondary instrumentation onboard the GRACE/GRACE-FO satellites are the ranging instrument (GRACE has a microwave ranging instrument, GRACE-FO has both a microwave ranging instrument and a laser interferometer), the global positioning system (GPS), the accelerometers and the star cameras.\n",
    "Data from these instruments are combined to estimate the distance between the two satellites, the positions of the satellites in space, the pointing vector of the satellites and any non-gravitational accelerations the satellites experience.\n",
    "These measurements combined with background gravity field estimates, atmospheric and oceanic variability estimates and tidal estimates are used to create the [Level-2 spherical harmonic product of GRACE and GRACE-FO](https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/podaac-ops-cumulus-docs/gracefo/open/docs/GRACE-FO_L2_UserHandbook.pdf).  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main processing centers that create the Level-2 spherical harmonic data as part of the GRACE/GRACE-FO Science Data System (SDS): the [University of Texas Center for Space Research (CSR)](http://www2.csr.utexas.edu/grace/), the [German Research Centre for Geosciences (GeoForschungsZentrum, GFZ)](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/grace/) and the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)](https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data is freely available in the US from the [NASA Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC)](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/grace) and internationally from the [GFZ Information System and Data Center](http://isdc.gfz-potsdam.de/grace-isdc/).\n",
    "There are programs within this repository that can sync with both of these data archives `podaac_cumulus.py` and `gfz_isdc_grace_ftp.py`.  \n",

    "### Geocenter\n",
    "Measurements of time-variable gravity from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and the GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) missions are set in a center of mass (CM) reference frame, in which the total degree one variations are inherently zero.\n",
    "The individual contributions to degree one variations in the CM reference frame, such as from oceanic processes or terrestrial water storage change, are not necessarily zero ([Wahr et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1029/98JB02844)).\n",
    "Applications set in a center of figure (CF) reference frame, such as the recovery of mass variations of the oceans, hydrosphere and cryosphere, require the inclusion of degree one terms to be fully accurate ([Swenson et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1029/2007JB005338)).\n",
    "The geocenter options above can select the degree one product to include with the GRACE/GRACE-FO derived harmonics of degree two and higher.\n",
    "There are options for using measurements from satellite laser ranging ([Cheng, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-32998-2_4)) and calculations from time-variable gravity and ocean model outputs ([Swenson et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1029/2007JB005338)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Low Degree Harmonics\n",
    "For both GRACE and GRACE-FO, there have been operational issues that have affected the quality of the time-variable gravity fields.\n",
    "During the late stages of the GRACE mission, procedures were enacted to preserve the battery life of the GRACE satellites and extend the mission lifetime.\n",
    "This included turning off the accelerometer and microwave ranging instrument (MWI) to reduce the battery load on the spacecraft during periods of low &beta; angle when solar input to the spacecraft is lowest.\n",
    "In late 2016, the accelerometer onboard GRACE-B was permanently powered down to help maintain the operation of the ranging instrument.\n",
    "For the Follow-On mission, an anomaly shortly after the launch of GRACE-FO caused a malfunction and the accelerometer onboard GRACE-FO 2 (GF2) has been operating in a less optimal Large-Range-Mode.\n",
    "For both of these cases, the GRACE/GRACE-FO processing centers have developed independent methods to spatiotemporally transplant the accelerometer data retrieved from GRACE-A to GRACE-B and from GF1 to GF2 ([Bandikova et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asr.2019.05.021)).\n",
    "These single-accelerometer months for both GRACE and GRACE-FO contain significantly more noise, particularly the low-degree zonal harmonics (predominantly <i>C</i><sub>20</sub> and <i>C</i><sub>30</sub> but possibly <i>C</i><sub>40</sub> and <i>C</i><sub>50</sub>).\n",
    "<i>C</i><sub>20</sub> has also been difficult for GRACE and GRACE-FO to independently measure throughout both missions.\n",
    "The figure axis harmonics (<i>C</i><sub>21</sub> and <i>S</i><sub>21</sub>) may also be contaminated\n",
    "by noise during the single-accelerometer months in the GFZ products [Dahle et al, 2019](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11182116).\n",
    "Measurements from satellite laser ranging (SLR) can provide an independent assessment for some low degree and order spherical harmonics ([Cheng et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1029/2010JB000850); [Cheng and Ries, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggx483); [Loomis et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL082929); [Loomis et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL085488)).\n",
    "The <i>C</i><sub>20</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>21</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>22</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>30</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>40</sub>, and <i>C</i><sub>50</sub> options below can select the SLR low degree product to use as a replacement for the GRACE/GRACE-FO derived estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Corrections\n",
    "Prior to GRACE/GRACE-FO Release-6, corrections needed to be applied to compensate for long-period signals in the pole tide that were contaminating the <i>C</i><sub>21</sub> and <i>S</i><sub>21</sub> harmonics ([Wahr et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1002/2015JB011986)), as well as for discontinuities in the atmospheric de-aliasing product that were introduced with upgrades in the ECMWF weather prediction model ([Fagiolini et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggv276)).  The Pole Tide and Atmospheric corrections do not need to be applied to the Release-6 data. "

    "### Geophysical Leakage\n",
    "Gravity measurements from GRACE and GRACE-FO are global, near-monthly and are directly related to changes in mass.\n",
    "Several mass transport processes can occur concurrently for a given region, which means that the total time-dependent geopotential from GRACE/GRACE-FO can relate to multiple time-varying components ([Wahr et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1029/98JB02844)).\n",
    "These mass transport processes include but are not limited to terrestrial water storage, glacier and ice sheet mass, atmospheric and oceanic circulation and geodynamic processes.\n",
    "In order to isolate the mass change of a single process, each of the other processes needs to be independently estimated and removed from the GRACE/GRACE-FO data.\n",
    "Uncertainties in the components removed from the GRACE/GRACE-FO data will directly impact the precision of the final mass balance estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filtering\n",
    "The GRACE/GRACE-FO coefficients are impacted by random spherical harmonic errors that increase as a function of spherical harmonic degree ([Wahr et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1029/98JB02844)).\n",
    "The impact of these errors can be reduced using Gaussian averaging functions as described in  [Jekeli, (1981)](http://www.geology.osu.edu/~jekeli.1/OSUReports/reports/report_327.pdf).\n",
    "GRACE/GRACE-FO coefficients are also impacted by correlated north/south \"striping\" errors, which can be spectrally filtered following [Swenson and Wahr (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2005GL025285).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Units\n",
    "Spatial fields of surface mass density can be estimated from sets of spherical harmonics if we assume that the mass redistributions are concentrated within a thin layer (thickness &#x226a; horizontal resolution) after correcting for glacial isostatic adjustment ([Wahr et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1029/98JB02844)).\n",
    "However, we additionally need to compensate for the Earth's elastic yielding to surface load changes, which induce density anomalies at depth ([Wahr et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1029/98JB02844)).\n",
    "This program accounts for the elastic deformation of the solid Earth using load Love numbers calculated by [Han and Wahr (1995)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.1995.tb01819.x) with parameters from the Preliminary reference Earth model (PREM).\n",
